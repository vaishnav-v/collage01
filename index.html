            <p>ABC College, Ranchi is a Minority Educational Institution based on religion which is established and
                maintained by the Ranchi Jesuit Province of the Society of Jesus. The College is registered by the
                Ranchi Province under the local title 'Xavier's Ranchi' under the Society's Registration Act XXI of
                1860.</p>
            <p>
                The Society of Jesus is a Christian Religious Order founded by St. Ignatius Loyolo in 1540. Since its
                foundation, the Jesuit Order, inspired by a Gospel vision of human beings and their destiny, has
                contributed to the Christian service of education throughout the world . This vision drawn from the life
                and teachings of Jesus Chirst gives Jesuit educational institutions a recognizable character and sets
                before their management, staff, students, parents and the community high ideals of life and service
                which will inspire them continuously to strive to meet the emerging needs and challenges. ABC
                College is an educational institution, which strives to prepare men and women who will build a more just
                and humane world. It strives to attain an intellectual endeavour that focuses on critical and creative
                thinking, with the aim of social transformation. The College makes a preferential option for the
                marginalised mass and it seeks to give an all round formation, inculcating both human and spiritual
                values. Competence, compassion and commitment are the hallmarks of a human person we seek to encourage.
